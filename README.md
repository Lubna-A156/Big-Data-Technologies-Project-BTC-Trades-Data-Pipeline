# Big-Data-Technologies-Project-BTC-Trades-Data-Pipeline
Project Overview
This project implements a real-time data pipeline for processing and analyzing BTC/USDT trade data from Binance's WebSocket API. The system ingests high-frequency trading data, processes it using a distributed architecture, and provides real-time analytics and price predictions through machine learning models.

## Key Features
Real-time Data Ingestion: Streams live BTC/USDT trade data from Binance WebSocket API

Distributed Processing: Uses Apache Spark for scalable data processing

Message Broker: Apache Kafka for reliable data streaming

## Storage Solutions:

InfluxDB for time-series data storage

Hadoop HDFS for historical data storage

Batch Processing: MapReduce for historical data aggregation

Machine Learning: Price prediction models (Linear Regression, Random Forest, GBT)

Visualization: Grafana dashboards for real-time monitoring
